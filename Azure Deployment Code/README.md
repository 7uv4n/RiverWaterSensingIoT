# RiverSensingIoT

## Overview
RiverSensingIoT is a project aimed at monitoring river conditions using IoT devices. This project collects data such as water level, temperature, and flow rate, and sends it to a cloud platform for analysis and visualization.

## Features
- Real-time data collection from multiple sensors
- Data transmission to Azure IoT Hub
- Cloud-based data storage and analysis
- Visualization of river conditions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Azure account
- IoT devices with sensors (e.g., water level sensor, temperature sensor)
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RiverSensingIoT.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
